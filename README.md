## The DebugDraw library for the HexaEngine
This library is a simple 3D debug drawing library for the HexaEngine in Immediate-mode. It allows you to draw lines, rectangles, circles, and text on the screen. It is useful for debugging and prototyping.

### Shapes:
- 3D Line
- Quad
- Ring
- Text (Coming soon)
- Images
- Boxes
- Spheres
- Planes
- Triangles
- Cylinders
- Cones
- Capsules

Note: The library is still in development, and more shapes will be added in the future. The primitive topology types must be supported by the graphics API to be displayed correctly.
